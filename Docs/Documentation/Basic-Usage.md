Basic Usage
===========

The easiest way to use this plugin is to execute it via command line like so:

```shell
Console/cake template
```

It will prompt you for the name of a model to start the process of baking code for it. The template shell will ask you several questions in order to customize final code for your app needs.

After the bake, don't expect all generated tests will be ready to run. You will need some fixture preparation and test tuning. In most cases it won't take more than 2-3 minutes to have new model and controller with 100% code coverage.
